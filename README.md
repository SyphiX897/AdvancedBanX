## Description
AdvancedBanX is an updated and modernized version of the original AdvancedBan
plugin made by Leoko. It is an All-In-One punishment system with warns, 
tempwarns, mutes, tempmutes, bans, tempbans, ipbans, and kicks. There is 
also player history so you can see players' past punishments. The plugin 
has configurable time & message layouts which automatically calculate and 
increase the punishment time for certain reasons. AdvancedBanX provides a 
full message file so you can change and translate all messages. There is 
also a detailed main configuration file with a lot of useful settings. At 
the moment, AdvancedBanX supports Bukkit (as well as spigot/paper) and 
Bungeecord. It also supports MySQL and Local File saving as it's storage 
platform.
